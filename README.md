# ShinyHLA: an R/Shiny-based web application for HLA typing of NGS data
ShinyHLA is an R/Shiny-based tool for HLA typing, supporting WES and RNA-seq data, integrating leading tools and databases, and offering a user-friendly interface with advanced visualization and analysis features.

- *Data compatibility: Supports HLA typing for both WES and RNA-seqdata.*
- *Integration of tools and database: Incorporates OptiType, arcasHLA, HLA-HD, and SpecHLA, along with the latest IPD-IMGT/HLA database.*
- *User-friendly interface: Provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that eliminates the need for programming experience.*
- *Enhanced data visualization and analysis: Incorporates a pivot table and the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) for efficient result review and comparison.*

## Website
The official web edition and documentation for ShinyHLA are available online. It provides:
1.	Step-by-step guides: Detailed instructions for tasks such as file upload, preprocessing, quality control, and HLA typing.
2.	Tutorials: Clear walkthroughs for both beginners and advanced users, demonstrating core features like HLA typing, result visualization using IGV, and pivot table usage for data integration.
